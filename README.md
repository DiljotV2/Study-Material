## Overview
<<Overview of the report goes here. This section is optional for P/C students .>>

<<For custom app students, please indicate briefly the custom application that you have completed and summarise your research/project findings. >>

## Evidence (in Portfolio Pieces)
I have completed the following assignments.
<<Please ensure you have deleted rows you have not completed. This means all outcomes need to be completed, not just submitted etc.
If some but not all outcomes have been completed, replace "All" with "Some" and list those outcomes completed. You should include a screenshot of your Learning Mastery page with your name showing clearly.>>

* All Core outcomes
* All Extension outcomes
* A project at Level 1
* An app at Level 2
* An app at Level 3

## Learning Summary

**For each of the unit outcomes**, point to tasks done throughout semester that address that outcome for this unit (aim for about 1 page in total). The entire report (including below) must be no more than 4 pages. 2-3 pages of content is often sufficient.

1. Explain the key differences between development of systems to run on mobile devices and on typical personal computing or internet-based environments, and apply this knowledge in the design of mobile device software.
2. Design effective applications for a mobile device by taking into consideration the underlying hardware-imposed restrictions such as screen size, memory size and processor capability.
3. Build, test and debug graphical applications for mobile devices by using the standard libraries that are bundled as part of the developersâ€™ toolkit for the mobile device.
4. (For COS80019 only) Independently research topics in mobile application architecture and/or security and/or performance.

### Challenges in Mobile Development

What are the key areas that need attention during (Android) mobile application development? You can use a visual model here if it helps.

Elaborate on aspects that you found challenging or different (to expectations) and why?

### Assumptions and Expectations

Discuss how mobile application is different/the same (in your opinion) compared to the other types of development that you have undertaken.
Compare and contrast new learning/information within the context of prior learning in the broader context of software development. This can also be about how you undertook your learning.

You can compare previous assumptions or expectations, with a discussion on how these have either been reinforced or changed.

### Explorations 

Present information about areas that you have personally explored beyond the unit content (if any), that relate to the unit outcomes. This should also include a reflection on the custom apps that you provided feedback on in week 12.

Indicate areas where you plan to learn further on your own, why that is of interest and how you will go about your learning activities.

### Final Words

What is the most useful thing you will take away from this unit? This should be no longer than a paragraph.
